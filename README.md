# üìù Multilingual Handwritten Text Recognition

##  Project Overview
This project focuses on developing a deep learning system for recognizing handwritten text across three categories:

- **Digits** (using the **MNIST** dataset)
- **English Words** (using the **IAM Handwriting** Dataset)
- **Arabic Characters** (using the **AHCD** dataset)

Separate models were built for each task, tailored to the challenges of each language and writing style.
The system uses **CNNs** for digit and Arabic character recognition and a **CNN-BiLSTM-CTC** architecture for English word recognition.

## How to Run the Code

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repo-link>
    ```

2. **Install required packages:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Open the notebooks:**
    - `MNIST.ipynb` ‚Äî Digit Recognition
    - `Final OCR.ipynb` ‚Äî English Word Recognition
    - `Arabic handwritten.ipynb` ‚Äî Arabic Character Recognition

4. **Train and evaluate** by running all cells in the notebook.
